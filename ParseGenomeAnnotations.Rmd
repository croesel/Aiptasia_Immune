To compare the results using the published genome annotations, supplemental data set 

http://www.pnas.org/highwire/filestream/620313/field_highwire_adjunct_files/1/pnas.1513318112.sd01.xlsx

was downloaded and sheet S1.1 was saved in .csv format. The 

```{r}
genomeAnnotations <- read.csv("pnas.1513318112.sd01.csv", header=T)
```
```{r}
rownames(genomeAnnotations) <- genomeAnnotations$Gene.identifier
head(genomeAnnotations)
